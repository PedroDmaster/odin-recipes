    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 175°C.</li>
        <li>For the crust:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Add the biscuits and sugar to the bowl of a food processor and process until fine crumbs form (you should have about 1 1/2 cups).</li>
                <li>Add the margarine and 2 tablespoons water to a measuring cup and melt in the microwave; add to the crumbs and blend until the mixture looks like wet sand.</li>
                <li>Pour the crumb mixture into the prepared pan; press it evenly into the bottom and use a measuring cup to smooth it evenly about 2 inches up the side.</li>
                <li>Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool completely on a rack.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>For the filling:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Add the tofu to the cleaned bowl of the food processor and process until smooth and very fluffy, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the vegan cream cheese, sugar, cornflour, vanilla, lemon juice and zest and orange juice and zest and process again until smooth and combined, 2 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Pour onto the cooled crust.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Bake the cheesecake until the outside is set but the center is still a bit loose, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and leave the cake in for 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool completely on a rack; cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>About 30 minutes prior to serving, remove the cake from the refrigerator (if it weeps overnight, gently dab the top with a clean paper towel).</li>
        <li>Remove the springform ring, top the cheesecake with fresh raspberries and serve.</li>
    </ol>
